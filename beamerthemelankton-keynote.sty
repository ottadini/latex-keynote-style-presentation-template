% Great template, really like this theme a lot! I did find out how to change 
% some of the things that others above had asked about:
% Getting the block environment to work is simply a matter of changing the 
% colors by adding the following to the style file:
\setbeamercolor{block title}{parent=normal text, bg=gray}
\setbeamercolor{block body}{parent=normal text, use=block title,bg=block title.bg!10!black}
% In this example, the parent causes the text to look like the normal text 
% (e.g. white in this theme) and a gray background for the block title, where 
% the block body is mixed with the block title background (10%) and black(90%).
% Note that the parent doesnâ€™t have to be used, it just inherits from the 
% parent, can also set fg and bg explicitly.
% As for changing the coloring of the table of contents, I used the following 
% in the style file to make the main sections a bit lighter & stand out more:
\setbeamercolor{section in toc}{use=structure,parent=structure,fg=structure.fg!50}
